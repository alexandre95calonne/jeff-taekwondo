# ‚ú® Jeff Coaching Taekwondo  ‚ú®

I created a landing page for a fitness coach as a freelance project. The page includes an integration with Calendly, allowing users to book sports sessions. The site is fully responsive across all sections, ensuring a seamless user experience on any device. Additionally, I also handled the hosting of the website.
